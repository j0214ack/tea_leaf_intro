 Amazon Launches One-Hour Delivery Service In Baltimore and Miami,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/CQFlw6f196w/amazon-launches-one-hour-delivery-service-in-baltimore-and-miami,"schwit1 writes Amazon.com announced the launch Thursday of its one-hour delivery service, Prime Now, in select zip codes in Baltimore and Miami. It initially launched in Manhattan in December. The one-hour service, available to Amazon Prime subscribers through the Prime Now mobile app, costs $7.99. Two-hour delivery is free. From the article: ""Amazon Prime's success has blown away the company's projections and 'petrified' local and national retailers, said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz &amp; Associates, a national retail consulting and investment banking firm headquartered in New York City. 'If you're a retailer and you're not scared of Amazon ... you should be,' he said. 'They are the change agent. They are leading the change in retail.'""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Amazon Wins US Regulators' Approval To Test-fly Drone,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/gQd-CzAfjMg/amazon-wins-us-regulators-approval-to-test-fly-drone,"mpicpp sends word that Amazon drones may soon deliver your packages. ""Amazon.com Inc has won U.S. federal regulators' approval to test a delivery drone, as the e-commerce giant pursues a vision of speeding packages to customers through the air amid public concern over the safety and privacy implications. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday it had issued an experimental airworthiness certificate to an Amazon unit and its prototype drone design, allowing it to conduct outdoor test flights on private, rural land in Washington state. The experimental certificate applies to a particular drone design and Amazon must obtain a new certification for test flights if it modifies the drone. In return, the company must supply monthly data to the regulators, and conduct flights at 400 feet (120 meters) or below and in 'visual meteorological conditions,' according to the FAA's certificate. The drone operators must also have a private pilots' license and current medical certification.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

For their efforts, HP awarded researchers $557,500. Is it reasonable to expect browser makers to hold their own in an arms race against exploits?

Quoting: ""In a lengthy investigation, staffers in the FTC's bureau of competition found evidence that Google boosted its own services for shopping, travel and local businesses by altering its ranking criteria and ""scraping"" content from other sites. It also deliberately demoted rivals. For example, the FTC staff noted that Google presented results from its flight-search tool ahead of other travel sites, even though Google offered fewer flight options. Google's shopping results were ranked above rival comparison-shopping engines, even though users didn't click on them at the same rate, the staff found.

'We found that if lunar lava tubes existed with a strong arched shape like those on Earth, they would be stable at sizes up to 5,000 meters, or several miles wide, on the moon,' Blair said. 'This wouldn't be possible on Earth, but gravity is much lower on the moon and lunar rock doesn't have to withstand the same weathering and erosion. In theory, huge lava tubes &ndash; big enough to easily house a city &ndash; could be structurally sound on the moon.'"" You can read their paper here (PDF). If this is so, then the possibility of huge colonies on the Moon increases significantly, as it will be much easier to build these colonies inside such lava tubes.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

what you see. Certain rainforest ant species can control their falls and glide
back onto the trunks of the trees they came from. Unlike Superman, though,
they're only flying to rescue themselves. An ant is light enough that a drop
to the forest floor might not hurt it. But the other animals cruising the
ground for snacks will cause trouble for that ant soon enough. That's why many

Hideo Kojima To Depart Konami; Metal Gear Franchise Changing Hands,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/KHDyDPsn3ew/hideo-kojima-to-depart-konami-metal-gear-franchise-changing-hands,"An anonymous reader writes: Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima is set to leave the video game publisher Konami, ending 29 years of service. Konami had announced a restructuring earlier this year, and observant fans recently noticed the removal of references to Kojima Productions from the company's web site. A source speaking to Gamespot states that both developments are the result of a ""power struggle"" between the studio and its parent. Konami has now confirmed to the English-speaking press that Kojima will work on The Phantom Pain until it is completed, but they are searching for new staff to take over the Metal Gear series. Kojima's only other announced project was Silent Hills, a horror game created in collaboration with Guillermo del Toro.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Leaked Document Reveals Upcoming Biometric Experiments At US Customs,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/s8NimEcoPwU/leaked-document-reveals-upcoming-biometric-experiments-at-us-customs,"sarahnaomi sends word of new biometric technologies coming to U.S. entry points. ""The facial recognition pilot program launched last week by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which civil liberties advocates say could lead to new potentially privacy-invading programs, is just the first of three biometric experiments that the feds are getting ready to launch. The three experiments involve new controversial technologies like iris and face scanner kiosks, which CBP plans to deploy at the Mexican border, and facial recognition software, according to a leaked document obtained by Motherboard. All three pilots are part of a broader Customs and Border Protection program to modernize screenings at American entry and exit ports, including at the highly politicized Mexican border, with the aid of new biometric technologies. The program is known as Apex Air Entry and Exit Re-Engineering Project, according to the leaked slides.

NZ Customs Wants Power To Require Passwords,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/BggSuCiBRTM/nz-customs-wants-power-to-require-passwords,"First time accepted submitter Orange Roughy writes New Zealand customs are seeking powers to obtain passwords and encryption keys for travelers. Supposedly they will only act to obtain credentials if it was acting on 'some intelligence or observation of abnormal behaviour.' People who refuse to hand over credentials could face up to three months jail time. From the story: ""Customs boss Carolyn Tremain has told MPs the department would only request travellers hand over passwords to their electronic devices if it had a reason to be suspicious about what was on them. The department unleashed a furore last week when it said in a discussion paper that it should be given unrestricted power to force people to divulge passwords to their smartphones and computers at the border. That would be without Customs officials having to show they had any grounds for suspicion.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

In fact, the barrier to entry is now so low that a group of biologists is calling for a moratorium on using the method to modify the human genome. Writing in the journal Science (abstract), the scientists warn that we've reached the point where the ethical questions surrounding DNA alteration can be put off no longer. David Baltimore, one of the group's members, said, ""You could exert control over human heredity with this technique, and that is why we are raising the issue. ... I personally think we are just not smart enough &mdash; and won't be for a very long time &mdash; to feel comfortable about the consequences of changing heredity, even in a single individual.""

Why Is the Grand Theft Auto CEO Also Chairman of the ESRB?,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/gqMIZGPQcC8/why-is-the-grand-theft-auto-ceo-also-chairman-of-the-esrb,"donniebaseball23 writes In an editorial at GamesIndustry.biz, Brendan Sinclair asks an important question about the game ratings board in America. Should Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two, which owns the Grand Theft Auto franchise and has been at the heart of the ESRB's biggest controversies of the last decade, really be serving as its chairman? ""No matter how removed from the day-to-day running of the ESRB Zelnick might be, his current role invites accusations of impropriety,"" he writes. ""It's the sort of thing any critic of the games industry can point to as a clear conflict of interest, and many reasonable outsiders would probably look at that as a valid complaint.
